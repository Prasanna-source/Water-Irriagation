# Water-Irriagation
Here I make a Water Irriagation System using Arduino Nano

		     

•	Connections:
GND of  RTC  --  GND of Arduino
VCC  of  RTC  --   5V of Arduino
SDA  of  RTC  --   A4  of  Arduino
SCL  of   RTC  --   A5  of Arduino  
Relay     I/P    --   D4  of   Arduino

•	BUG Conveter O/P:
O/P  of BUG (+ve)  --   +5 of Arduino
O/P  of BUG (-ve)  --    GND  of   Arduino

•	Procedure:
All required programs for this project I provided in this Folder. There are three  programs I arranged by sequence, you just upload it sequence wise.  
Arduino-DS3231-master   before uploading any program at first install this library  in your arduino IDE  these are installing path(Sketch/Include library/ Add zip library).
	Now are free to upload the programs …
